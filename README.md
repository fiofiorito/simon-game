# simon-game

## Overview
The Simon game is a popular electronic game that tests the memory skills of the players.
The game consists of four colored buttons, each of which produces a different tone when pressed. 
The game starts with one of the buttons lighting up at random. The player then has to repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. If the player succeeds in repeating the sequence correctly, the game adds another button to the sequence, making it longer.
The game continues until the player makes a mistake or until the sequence becomes too long for the player to remember.

## Challenges
### syntax
The main challenge I faced was getting the JavaScript sintax right.
The logic was there in my case as I could easily explain the logic behind every step I neeeded to take, but I struggled quite a bit when it came to writing the JS code. It is the hardest thing for me at the moment becuase I recently started learning it, but I know that with enough practise it is gonna become easy peassy just as HTML and CSS became!!

### making it work on mobile
I didnt think of this when I was done with the proyect. I did think about making the layout mobile responsive so that it would look nice on mobile as well. Once I uploaded the files here and created the link for the page and opened it on my phone, I realized I couldn't play on mobile bc I don't have a physical keyboard.
So I fixed the bug by adding a conditional to the starting game function and now it should work just fine on both!
